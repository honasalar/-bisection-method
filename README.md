📌Bisection Method — Numerical Analysis Extra Work

This project demonstrates how to find the root of a nonlinear equation using the Bisection Method.
It is completed as an extra assignment for my Numerical Analysis course.

🧠 About the Bisection Method

The Bisection Method is a numerical algorithm used to approximate the value of a root where:

f(x) = 0


✨ Key idea:
We pick an interval [a, b] where the function changes sign, meaning:

f(a) * f(b) < 0


Then we repeatedly:

1️⃣ Find midpoint → m = (a + b) / 2
2️⃣ Check sign of f(m)
3️⃣ Replace either a or b with m
4️⃣ Repeat until error is very small ✅

This guarantees convergence as long as the function is continuous and the sign changes in the interval.

📐 Function Used
f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5


Root lies approximately between 1 and 3.
